Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 350 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.108 nm, buffer size 0.108 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.034 nm, buffer size 0.034 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 160x160x160, spacing 0.095 0.095 0.095
This run will generate roughly 37 Mb of data
